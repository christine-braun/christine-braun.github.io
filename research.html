		  <li> Aggregate Job Search of the Employed, Unemployed, and Non-Participants [<a href="pdfs/Braun-jobsearchers.pdf">draft</a>] <br><br>
					<u> Abstract:</u> I document a substantial rise in the proportion of job seekers who are classified as out of the labor force. Accounting for these searchers increases the unemployment rate by 5.2 percentage points, rids the unemployment rate of its downward trend, and decreases volatility by 50%. The paper also delivers a total searcher rate, including employed job seekers, and adjusted labor market flows. I show that accounting for all job seekers has a significant impact on the volatility of key labor market statistics and the persistence of unemployment. Finally, estimates of the Phillips Curve using the adjusted unemployment rate or total searcher rate show no sign of a flattening output-inflation relationship in the post-2008 recession period.

Productivity of Work, with Travis Cyronek and Peter Rupert [<a href="pdfs/bcr.pdf">draft</a>][<a href="pdfs/vcu_slides.pdf">slides</a>] <br><br>
  					<u> Abstract:</u> We document a considerable rise in hours worked at home and a small decline in hours not working at work brought about by the 2008 recession. In 2019, workers spent on average 4.5 hours per week working from home and 2.15 hours not working at work. We show that the increase in working from home cannot be accounted for by changes between occupations, but rather by increased computer use within occupations. We also document a substantial increase in the productivity of working from home relative to at the workplace. In 2003, an hour worked at home was about 2% less productive than an hour at the workplace, but in 2019 an hour at home was 12% more productive. The increase in relative productivity can be accounted for by less work from home occurring while also providing childcare and more work from home occurring during standard business hours rather than in the early morning or late evening. Finally, 10% of the increase in labor productivity since 2009 can be attributed to the substitution from working at the office to working from home.
