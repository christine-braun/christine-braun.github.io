		  <li> Aggregate Job Search of the Employed, Unemployed, and Non-Participants [<a href="pdfs/Braun-jobsearchers.pdf">draft</a>] <br><br>
					<u> Abstract:</u> I document a substantial rise in the proportion of job seekers who are classified as out of the labor force. Accounting for these searchers increases the unemployment rate by 5.2 percentage points, rids the unemployment rate of its downward trend, and decreases volatility by 50%. The paper also delivers a total searcher rate, including employed job seekers, and adjusted labor market flows. I show that accounting for all job seekers has a significant impact on the volatility of key labor market statistics and the persistence of unemployment. Finally, estimates of the Phillips Curve using the adjusted unemployment rate or total searcher rate show no sign of a flattening output-inflation relationship in the post-2008 recession period.

  		  <li> Measuring the Productivity of Working from Home, with Travis Cyronek and Peter Rupert [<a href="pdfs/bcr.pdf">draft</a>] <br><br>
  					<u> Abstract:</u> We estimate occupation level relative productivities of working from home using a model in which workers choose the location (home or workplace) and quantity of hours. The resulting estimates show that aggregate relative produc- tivity of working from home has increased by 27% since 2003 which is driven by within occupation increases in relative productivity rather than changes in the employment composition across occupations. Using the estimated model, we decompose the increase in weekly hours worked at home since 2003, finding that two-thirds of the increase stems from increases in the relative productivity and one-third form changes in the employment composition.

    		  <li> Labor Market Beliefs and the Gender Wage Gap, with Ana Figueiredo [draft coming soon] <br><br>
    					<u> Abstract:</u> We study how job seekersâ€™ beliefs of their labor market outcomes affect reservation wages and, in turn, average wages and the gender wage gap in equilibrium. We show that women, on average have lower reservation wages, are less optimistic about how many offers they will receive, and less optimistic about the underlying offer distribution they face. We show that these differences in beliefs can account for about 30% of the gender wage gap, and that the effect varies largely with education, marital status, and motherhood. Differences in beliefs among all college educated workers account for more than the entire gender wage gap, however, among this group, the effect for married women with children only accounts for 18% of the wage gap.
